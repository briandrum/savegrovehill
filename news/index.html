        <p>On Jan. 10, 1964, Barbara Kuniczak sold her house at 126 E. Washington St., Chagrin Falls, to five citizens, who formed a private trust to prevent its demolition. The builder of the May Court and Elm Court extensions wanted the property for access to his planned development.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kuniczak’s house had been built c. 1847 by George March, an original settler of Chagrin Falls. It is the third oldest occupied residence in the village, and a noted example of Western Reserve architecture, painted red.</p>
        <p>Two couples who were neighbors of that house and a venerated real estate broker pooled resources to buy the house and rent it for a quarter century. They took out a mortgage, before selling the property to persons who have preserved the unique place of the original March house in local architectural history.</p>
        <p>The property at 3 West Summit may be slated for an ignominious destruction, but with sufficient private investment and a motivated seller, its neighbors and supporters could save this equally notable specimen of local history.</p>

        <p>Chagrin is on the verge of losing its iconic Grove Hill.</p>
        <p>Yes, that hill: site of the Pumpkin Roll; starting line for the Euclid Beach rocket car’s scream-inducing rides; and the place from which many take in the wonder of our Norman Rockwell-like town for the first time.</p>
        <p>At a Nov. 19 meeting of the town’s Architectural Review Board, the new owner of the property on the southwest corner of Grove Hill (3 West Summit), developer Robert Vitt, announced plans to:</p>
        <p>Demolish the historic Bancroft House that sits at the crest of the property and its annex building to make way for two new homes facing West Summit Street.</p>
        <p>Remove 1,000 tons of soil to “stabilize” the hillside to construct three new, 3-story townhomes near the bottom of the property on West Cottage Street.</p>
        <p>Yes, 1,000 tons. As in 2 million pounds. From a hillside so fragile that, according to court documents, excavations for the same developer’s West Orange townhomes triggered landslides. Is there any doubt that this development plan poses enormous risk to Grove Hill and the surrounding structures and roads?</p>
        <p>At the meeting, some ARB members challenged the developer to be a “steward” of the property and a “hero” to the community by restoring the Bancroft House and respecting its historical site. But the developer was unmoved, responding that he would prefer to pass that role to someone else.</p>
        <p>What to do? If there is someone out there with the means and fortitude to be a community hero, please reveal yourself as soon as possible. For everyone else:</p>

        <p>Back in the last century, 1955 to be exact, a folk singer named Pete Seeger wrote a song born of the “Ban the Bomb” movement and the never-ending cycle of war, death and those left behind to repeat the folly.</p>
        <p>A decade later, the revival of folk music collided with “hell no, we won’t go” protests and became an anthem for the anti-Vietnam War generation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seeger named his tune “Where Have All the Flowers Gone?” Remember the words?</p>
        <p>“Where have all the flowers gone, long time passing? Where have all the flowers gone, long time ago?”</p>
        <p>It goes on to answer its own questions as the verses are revealed.</p>

        <p>CHAGRIN FALLS — Developer Robert Vitt was on Tuesday morning’s Architectural Review Board agenda with an application to move the house at 3 W. Summit St. to provide space for a new outbuilding. He left the meeting asking to demolish it instead.</p>
        <p>The home is a historical and visible landmark in the village at the very top of Grove Hill (North Main Street).</p>
        <p>“We were united as a board,” said ARB member Dr. Steve King in a telephone call following the session.</p>
        <p>He said the reasons given for demolition are the same as for every demolition request the board has reviewed in the past – low ceilings, mold, damp basement, knob and tube electrical wiring.</p>
        <p>“In other words, like most of the houses in Chagrin Falls,” Dr. King added.</p>
        <p>Because Mr. Vitt changed his request from moving the house to demolishing it, his original application was void and he will be required to reapply for a demolition permit.</p>
        <p>In Chagrin Falls, demolition requests must be accompanied by plans for the replacement structure.

    <h3 class="Heading Heading--size500">Chagrin Falls family files lawsuit against Orange Street condominium developers – May 03, 2011</h3>
    <p>CHAGRIN FALLS — A lawsuit has been filed against the developer of the River Walk Townhomes currently being constructed on Orange Street.</p>
    <p>The West Cottage Street home of Terry and David Mitchell is sliding down an adjacent hill because of the construction below their property, according to lawyer Tom Merriman, who is representing the Mitchells.</p>
    <p>Robert Vitt's Silver Leaf development company has started construction on a condominium development on West Orange Street. The Mitchells' home sits on a crest on top of a hill that slopes down to that development.</p>
    <p>“They (the developers) didn’t test to see if they gutted the hillside, what would happen to the properties at the top of the hill,” Merriman said.</p>
